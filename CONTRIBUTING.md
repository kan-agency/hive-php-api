-------

This package accepts contributions via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/kan-agency/hive-php-api).

### Pull Requests

- **Coding Standards** - The easiest way to apply the coding conventions is to run PHPCS with settings which already reside within the repository. See below for how to do so.

- **Add tests!** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the README and CHANGELOG and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **Consider our release cycle** - This package follows semver.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful.
